# E11a-3D
In this exercise we are creating our first 3D "game" in godot. We are utilizing tansform and other things such as cameras to make the game look and feel more like a real game. In this I have created a map that doesn't really have a large game feel. It is just something simple to show the user that we can move and jump on the 3D objects we have created.
